\subsection{Overview of Document}
The plans for testing will include the description of the software, the team to test it, the approach to automated testing, the tools for testing and the schedule for testing. After that, it will go through all the detailed tests for requirements specified in SRS along with the proof of concept.Lastly we will compare with the original implementation and discuss the unit testing plan.
\section{Plan}	
\subsection{Software Description}
Space Invaders is a fixed shooter in which the player moves aircraft horizontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at monsters overhead. The original repository was using pygame and python to implement. We will use python and pygame to implement it and apply the software principles to redevelop the game. Additionally, we will upgrade the graphic user interface of it.
\subsection{Test Team}
The core test team consists of all members of Group-07 are responsible for writing and executing tests:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tingyu Shi
\item Qianlin Chen
\item Jiacheng Wu
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}
In this project, we mainly use the exploration test since we will test the display and controller and the tests of those depend on the input of the users.However, the unit test will be one of our automated testing approach to test our models. Models include the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Monster
\item MonsterMatrix
\item SpaceShip
\item Score
\item Bullets
\end{itemize}
Since the game is still in the process of implementation,
more models may be created in the future.
\subsection{Testing Tools}
The testing tool we are going to use is Pytest. It's a testing tool used for unit test for python programs.
\subsection{Testing Schedule}

Output/Result: Aircraft shoots one bullet.\\
How the test will be performed: Developers start the 
game by executing \verb|python Driver.py| and then press
\verb|SPACE| to check if aircraft can shoot one bullet.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Comparison to Existing  Implementation}
When this document is finished, the following contents
have been implemented:
\begin{itemize}
\item Monster Model
\item SpaecShip Model
\item Score Model
\item Bullet Model
\item Single Player Controller
\item Background, Title and Icon
\item The corresponding views of the four models
\end{itemize}
\section{Unit Testing Plan}
\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}
Unit tests for this project will mainly be applied to test
our models. The unit testing frame we choose is \verb|Pytest|. The following are steps for of unit testing:
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Create object from different model class.
\item Provide different inputs and call different methods.
\item Compare the return values with the excepted values.
\end{enumerate}
Some sample examples for  unit testing:
\begin{itemize}
\item Monster Class
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|reduce_life()|
\item \verb|isDead()|
\item setter and getters for x, y coordinates.
\end{itemize}
\item Score Class
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|increaseScore()|
\item \verb|getScore()|
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Unit testing of output files}
This game will not generate and output files. As a result,
no unit tests will be applicable for output files.
\section{Appendix}
\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|DEFAULT_SPACESHIP_SPEED = 3|
\item \verb|DEFAULT_SPACESHIP_X = 370|
\item \verb|DEFAULT_SPACESHIP_Y = 530|
\item \verb|DEFAULT_MONSTER_SPEED = 1|
\item \verb|DEFAULT_BULLET_SPEED = 20|
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Usability Survey Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item How would you describe the difficulty of this game?
(Level 10 is the most difficult and level 1 is the 
least difficult)
\item Do you have any recommended features that we should
implement in the future?
\item Is this game difficult to learn to play? (Level 10 is the most difficult and level 1 is the 
least difficult)
\end{itemize}
